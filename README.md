# Hey, I'm Surendra 👋

**Web Scraping Engineer** based in Nepal with 9 years of experience building production-grade data extraction systems.

I specialize in turning unstructured web data into clean, scalable pipelines. From e-commerce pricing intelligence to real estate aggregation, I've built scrapers that handle millions of records while respecting rate limits and avoiding detection.

## Tech Stack

**Extraction:** Scrapy, Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup
**Backend:** Python, Django, FastAPI, Node.js
**Queues & Workers:** Redis, Celery, BullMQ
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Pandas
**Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS EC2, Linux

## What I Build

**Production Scrapers** — High-volume data collection systems with proxy rotation, fingerprint management, and anti-detection measures.

**Data Pipelines** — ETL workflows that transform raw HTML into structured data ready for analysis or storage.

**Automation Tools** — Browser automation for tasks that require login sessions, JavaScript rendering, or complex user flows.

**Distributed Systems** — Queue-based architectures that scale horizontally across multiple workers.

## Industries I've Worked In

- **E-commerce** — Product catalogs, pricing intelligence, seller analytics, marketplace automation
- **Real Estate** — Property listings aggregation, market data collection, MLS scraping
- **Recruiting** — Job postings, company data, contact enrichment
- **Finance** — Alternative data feeds, public records extraction
- **Lead Generation** — B2B contact data, company intelligence
